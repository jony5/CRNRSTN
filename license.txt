#  OVERVIEW :: CRNRSTN is an open source PHP class library that facilitates the operation of an application within multiple server 
#			   environments (e.g. localhost, stage, preprod, and production). With this tool, data and functionality with 
#			   characteristics that inherently create distinctions from one environment to the next...such as IP address restrictions, 
#			   error logging profiles, and database authentication credentials...can all be managed through one framework for an entire 
#			   application. Once CRNRSTN has been configured for your different hosting environments, seamlessly release a web 
#			   application from one environment to the next without having to change your code-base to account for environmentally 
#			   specific parameters; and manage this all from one place within the CRNRSTN Suite ::
